ðŸš€ Insurance Premium Predictor (FastAPI & Streamlit)
A full-stack machine learning application that predicts the insurance premium category for users based on their age, BMI, income, occupation, city tier, and smoking habits.

ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project integrates a trained ML model into a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit frontend. It takes user inputs, computes dynamic risk factors (like BMI and lifestyle risk), and predicts the insurance premium category in real time.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic, Scikit-learn

Frontend: Streamlit

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Requests, joblib

ðŸ“¦ Features
Real-time insurance premium prediction

BMI, lifestyle risk, and age group computed dynamically

Tier-based city classification

Streamlit-based user-friendly UI

Clean and modular codebase
